<center>A Quick Backstory to the Existence of Anime</center>
<p>1951 - Osamu Tezuka created the milestone manga, Tetsuwan Atom or Astro Boy, as it was known in the US. 
As a result, years later he became a pioneer in anime, and was the man responsible for the success of anime and manga worldwide. 
Otogi Manga Calendar, was the first anime series to be produced and the first to be televised. 
It ran from 1961-1964. Astro Boy first aired in 1963, making it one of the older anime series, but not the oldest.
Imokawa Mukuzo Genkanban no Maki is considered to be the first professional anime film. It was created by Oten Shimokawa in 1917. 
The mainstream production of anime began during World War II. 
Momotaro: Umi no Shinpei (1945) which was a propaganda film is the first anime feature-length film.
The history of anime began at the start of the 20th century, when Japanese filmmakers experimented with the animation techniques that were being explored in the West. 
The first generation of animators in the late 1910s included Oten Shimokawa, Jun'ichi Kouchi and Seitaro Kitayama, referred to as the "fathers" of anime.

<center>Anime and Me</center>
<p>I grew up with anime. 
Everyday before school and when I was just a kid every morning I'd watch Doraemon, Pokemon, and Dragonball Z. 
I didn't know that there were more than just those three but I loked into it when I was 10 because I thought it was just amazing. 
Still now I look out for some great anime I have not yet had the pleasure of viewing.
So far I have probably watched over 50 anime series throughout my life time.
My favorite and most treasured anime series is "Mahou Sensei Negima?!" and it's not that well known or rather it's fandom is very quiet.

Hey there, My name is Nairah, don’t worry I know that it’s pretty hard to pronounce.
 It’s cool but that’s not the reason why I made this website.
 I made it because I just want to make people’s life easier with a quick way to find out about what exactly Anime is and which you think would suite you the most.
 Also I have suggested some anime to start off with.
 So have a look around and see if you’re interested at all and maybe just go for it.
